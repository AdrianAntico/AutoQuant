#### Modeling and utility tools for R users

##### Supervised Learning Functions: 
1. **AutoH20Modeler**: Automatically builds many models with full interpretation, grid tuning, and file storage for easy production implementation
    2. RandomForest
    3. GBM
    4. Deeplearning
2. **AutoTS**: automatically finds the best of each of the models below (with optimized box-cox transformations), generates forecasts, and evaluation metrics
    3. ARIFIMA: Auto Regressive Fractional Integrated Moving Average
    4. ARIMIA: Stepwise Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average with specified max lags, seasonal lags, moving averages, and seasonal moving averages
    5. Exponential Smoothing: Additive and Multiplicitive Exponential Smoothing and Holt Winters
    6. Auto Regressive Neural Network: up to 50 lags and 50 seasonal lags compared
    7. TBATS: Exponential smoothing state space model with Box-Cox transformation, ARMA errors, Trend and Seasonal components
    8. Cubic Smoothing Spline: Additive regression on an ARIMA(0,2,2) model structure
    9. Prophet: Additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects
3. **nlsModelFit**: automatically finds the best model fit from the suite of models below and merges predictions to source data file
    4. Asymptotic
    5. Asymptotic through origin
    6. Asymptotic with offset
    7. Bi-exponential
    8. Four parameter logistic
    9. Three parameter logistic
    10. Gompertz
    11. Michel Menton
    12. Weibull
    13. Polynomial regression or monotonic regression

##### Unsupervised Learning Functions: 
4. **GenTSAnomVars**: create indicator variables based on control limits methodology over a max of two grouping variables and a date variable
5. **ResidualOutliers**: utilize tsoutliers to indicate outliers within a time series data set
6. **GLRM_KMeans_Col**: generate a column with a cluster identifier based on a grid tuned (optional) generalized low rank model and an grid tuned K-Means algorithm

##### Feature Engineering Functions: 
7. **FAST_GDL_Feature_Engineering**: rapidly generate time between events, autoregressive, moving average / standard deviation / min / max / quantile 85 / quantile 95
8. **GDL_Feature_Engineering**: generate a wider set of features (like FAST_GDL) using any aggregation statistic for the moving features
9. **Scoring_GDL_Feature_Engineering**: generate the model features from FAST_GDL or GDL for scoring purposes when the scoring data is for forward looking predictions (not historical, which can be obtained from AutoH20Modeler)
10. **Word2VecModel**: Generate a specified number of vectors for each column of text data in your data set and save the models for re-creating them for later scoring purposes
11. **ModelDataPrep**: Rapidly convert "inf" values to NA, convert character columns to factor columns, and impute with specified values for factor and numeric columns

##### Model Evaluation and Utility Functions: 
12. **ParDepCalPlots**: Build a partial dependence calibration plot on train, test, or all data
13. **EvalPlot**: Build a calibration plot on test data
14. **threshOptim**: Generate a cost-sensitive optimized threshold and save to scoring file
