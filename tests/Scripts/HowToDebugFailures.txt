There is a specific method for doing this. I can list out the steps
1. Identify which iteration caused the failure case. Predefine run = iteration number
2. Uncomment the code below the QA loop as needed. They are the parameters pre defined
3. Open up the file that contains the function you'''re testing. Here, the AutoCatBoostMultiClass.R file
4. Go to the very first line of code inside the function and click control + enter
5. Go until you reach the error
6. Identify which function caused the error (or code in the script)
7. Track down where that function is located. control + shift + f to search for something across the files in the R folder inside RemixAutoML
8. Uncomment the code in the QA file associated with the function that caused the error and predefine the functions
9. Step through that function until you find the error
10. Hit me up
How can I pin all those in one shot?
