Description: Automates and ensures high quality output for most
    of your machine learning and data science tasks. The package contains
    high quality functions that run at efficient speed with minimal memory
    constraints for supervised learning, unsupervised learning, feature
    engineering, model evaluation and interpretation, along with some
    helper functions for graphing. AutoCatBoostClassifier(),
    AutoCatBoostRegression(), and AutoCatBoostMultiClass() have a
    dependency to the catboost package which isn't part of the CRAN
    repository at the time of this writing. The link to the catboost URL
    to download the package for use is in the Additional_repositories
    field below, which has the installation instructions. You need to
    install that package to make use of the AutoCatBoost_ functions.
