Version: 1.2.1
Description: Automates and ensures high quality output for most of your machine learning and data science tasks. The package contains high quality functions that run at efficient speed with minimal memory constraints for supervised learning, unsupervised learning, feature engineering, model evaluation and interpretation, along with some helper functions for graphing. AutoCatBoostClassifier and AutoCatBoostRegression have a dependency to the catboost package which isn't part of the CRAN repository at the time of this writing. The link to the catboost URL to download the package for use is in the Additional_repositories field below, which has the installation instructions. You need to install that package to make use of the AutoCatBoost_ functions.
