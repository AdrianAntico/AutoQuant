Description: Automates and ensures high quality output for most
    of your machine learning and data science tasks. The package contains
    high quality functions that run at efficient speed with minimal memory
    constraints for supervised learning, unsupervised learning, feature
    engineering, model evaluation and interpretation, along with some
    helper functions for graphing. AutoCatBoostClassifier and
    AutoCatBoostRegression have a dependency to the catboost package which
    isn't part of the CRAN repository at the time of this writing. The
    link to the catboost URL to download the package for use is in the
    Additional_repositories field below, which has the installation
    instructions. You need to install that package to make use of the
    AutoCatBoost_ functions.
